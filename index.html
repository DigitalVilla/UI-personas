            <div class="card_bio">
                <p>George and his wife have lived in Calgary their whole life. She is a pharmacist at the Peter Lougheed hospital and he just retired last year. "I married a young woman", he jokes when mentioning his wife age, 51. They own one car but his wife takes it to work and he never felt the need to buy a second one as his job as an accountant was right in the core of downtown. He and his wife live in the lower Mount Royal area.</p>
                <p>George does not use the transit much these days, however, he likes to surprise his wife during her lunch breaks or when she is about to finish her shift. He says it gives her butterflies to see him all dressed up asking her out for a 30-minute date in the cafeteria. He loves to see her nervous smile. Sometimes he also visits his grandchildren who live close to the Chinook mall.
                </p>
                <p>He does not track his commute time very well, he usually plans for one hour and a half to two hours and more often than not he arrives a bit too early to his destination. “When you get to be my age you will see time as a boundary and value more the experiences and the memories that each day leaves”.</p>
                <p>George likes to use Calgary’s transit and go through the city picturing the old times and the new times of the places and buildings he sees. George has photos at home of an unknown town whose population barely reached a few hundred thousand. He treasures this knowledge and sees it more as a privilege than a sign of age. George has lived through the tough and the happy moments of this city and he has grown and matured along with it. </p>

                <p>Sara’s family moved to Calgary when she was 17 years old. She knows the main areas of the city such as parks, malls and museums as she and her family used to tour around Calgary every weekend. </p>
                <p>Now she lives in Brentwood with two of her best friends where they share the rent of a Duplex. She is currently working as a first grade teacher at Elboya Elementary Jr High School. Every weekday Sara wakes up early in the morning to go to the gym, she usually brings a change of clothes as she goes directly from the
                    gym to the cTrain station. </p>
                <p>Sara’s average commute is about 45 minutes each way. She takes the route 201 to city center and then she transfers to bus route 3 on 5th street and 7 avenue SW. She then proceeds to ride it all the way to 47 Ave SW where her school is found a few steps toward the east. </p>
                <p>She believes that driving would be a waste of her time, especially if the places she goes to are close to a cTrain and/or bus station, “During my commute I can read, check social media, make plans for the weekend, and even review and mark tests”. I do not have to worry about traffic, parking, stoplights or other people driving around me. I just get on the bus and It takes me where I want to go”. </p>
                <p>Sara believes that by utilizing the extra 90 minutes of daily commute, she is able to have her weekends free of work and major responsibilities, aside from buying groceries and cleaning the house that she and her friends rent. </p>

            <div class="card_bio">
                <p>Brad was born in Medicine Hat. He just moved to Calgary last September to go to SAIT. Even though he has visited Calgary multiple times before it was only to visit his Aunt and cousins at Canyon meadows, therefore he does not know the city very well. </p>
                <p>He decided to accept his Aunt’s offer and live with her and her family while in college. She does not like to accept his money so he buys her fruit and groceries whenever he gets a chance. He likes to be with them because they are family and make him feel welcome. “My Aunt reminds me that a longer commute today is a shorter debt tomorrow” he says smiling. </p>
                <p>Brad’s main way of transportation is the cTrain. His uncle usually drops him and his 2 cousins at the canyon meadows station and on his way back he either takes the bus route 28 or walks home. He likes the cTrain but believes it could be a little bit faster between stations. </p>
                <p>He also enjoys to watch the Peace Officers getting on the train at random to catch the free loaders. “If people would only pay 3 dollars they could also enjoy the ride” says Brad as he points out his window at the moving scenery of Calgary’s downtown morning hustle.</p>
